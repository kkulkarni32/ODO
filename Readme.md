This is a testing branch and as of now, only chabot can be tested. We have tried to mimic MAX system's OSC communication using client.py and server.py.
client.py serves as MAX system which sends the tags to the server and server.py accepts these tags and uses them to trigger different events in the main odo code. Run server.py, client.py and new_odo_chatbot_merged.py in the order. Make sure the ip address mentioned all the 3 files are pointing to your local machine since server and client both will be running on the local. E:g use -  python new_odo_chatbot_merged.py --maxip 192.168.0.100 --chatip --maxip 192.168.0.100
